# llm-grammar
A lot of LLM grammar files, which works in **llama.cpp**. They are all in **.gbnf** format(**G**GML **B**ackus-**N**aur **F**orm). 

To learn how to use these in your application, go to the [**llama.cpp documentation**](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/grammars/README.md).

These grammar files were collected from various open source repos. I did not make any of them.
